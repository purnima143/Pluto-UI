## Technologies

The following technologies and programming languages are used in our project:

   - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
   - Storybook: A development environment and UI component explorer for building UI components in isolation.
  -  PropTypes: A library for type checking React component props.
   - SCSS: A CSS preprocessor that enhances the capabilities of CSS.:

## Color Code 
Must follow this color code when creating a component.To ensure consistency and visual coherence, Pluto UI follows a specific color code. When creating new components, it is important to adhere to this color code for a unified look and feel throughout the UI library.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
### Installation

To install Pluto UI, clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pluto-ui.git
```

Then, navigate to the cloned repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```
cd pluto-ui
npm install
```
Run Storybook:
```
npm run storybook
```
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:6006 to view the Storybook interface.
### Usage
With Storybook up and running, you can interact with the individual components, explore their variations, and test their behavior in different scenarios directly in your browser. This allows you to see how the components look and function in isolation and helps you integrate them seamlessly into your own ecommerce website.

## Guidelines for Writing SCSS

When writing SCSS code for our project, please adhere to the following guidelines:

* Classname Convention: Use the following naming convention for SCSS class names:
```
    scss

    .pluto--<element-name> {
      /* Styles for the element */
    }
```
   For example, if you are creating a button component, the SCSS class should be named .pluto--button. This convention helps ensure consistency and avoids naming conflicts.

  *  Modular Approach: Keep the SCSS styles modular and component-based. Each component should have its own SCSS file, organizing the styles specific to that component.

  *  Reusability: Aim for reusable SCSS styles to promote consistency and reduce duplication. Extract common styles into reusable mixins or variables.

  *  Maintainability: Keep the SCSS code clean, readable, and well-organized. Use indentation, comments, and appropriate naming conventions to enhance code maintainability.

  *  Responsiveness: Consider responsive design principles and write SCSS styles that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

   * BEM Methodology: Consider utilizing the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for naming classes and structuring the SCSS code. This methodology helps create maintainable and scalable styles.

Please ensure that the SCSS code follows these guidelines to maintain a consistent and organized codebase for our UI library.

Feel free to modify and expand upon these guidelines to fit the specific requirements of your project.
## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. Here are some guidelines to get started:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`. For example, if you are working on the Navbar component, you can create a branch named `navbar`.
2. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`.
3. Push to your forked repository: `git push origin your-branch-name`.
4. Open a pull request to the main repository's branch(master) and mention which component you have worked on. 

For example, if you have made changes to the Navbar component, you can mention it in the pull request title or description: "Feature: Updated Navbar component".
